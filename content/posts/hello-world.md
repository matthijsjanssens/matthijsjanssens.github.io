First things first... 

```Python
# What a time to be alive!
print('Hello world!')
```

*Hello world!*

With that out of the way...

Video games and the processes to build them are ever evolving, and I struggle to contain my enthusiasm whenever there's an opportunity to talk about these things. So much so that, after working a decade in games, I decided to start a blog to share some ideas that might excite like-minded people out there.

Special thanks to the developers of the following free tools which made the creation of this blog an absolute joy:

* [Hugo](https://gohugo.io)
* [Hugo Notice](https://github.com/martignoni/hugo-notice)
* [Hugo PaperMod](https://github.com/adityatelange/hugo-PaperMod)
* [Giscus](https://giscus.app)
* [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com)
* [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com)

Peace out!
