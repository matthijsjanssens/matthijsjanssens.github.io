First things first... 

```Python
# What a time to be alive!
print('Hello world!')
```

**Hello world!**

With that out of the way...

Games and the processes to build them are ever evolving, and I struggle to contain my enthusiasm whenever there's an opportunity to talk about related topics. So much so that I decided to start a blog, after working well over a decade in video games, to share some of the ideas that might also excite other fellow nerds out there.

Special thanks to the freely available tools that have made setting up this blog a joy:

* [Hugo](https://gohugo.io)
